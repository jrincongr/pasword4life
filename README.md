## Task

A Canadian Company hired me to create an application, that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.


## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password the algorithm starts working,
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria like "Vowels, consonants, special characters, numbers...."
WHEN prompted for password criteria choose if you want or not the elements on your password
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password, there are a lot of options.
WHEN prompted for the length of the password

WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
